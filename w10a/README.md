Notice two projects: server-side WebAPI and client-side project that includes a Default.html page. 
Apart from looking at the code to understand how it works, you can ignore the server-side WebAPI service because it is deployed for you at http://flintstones.zift.ca/api/flintstones/.

Server Side

http://flintstones.zift.ca/api/flintstones/
Client Side

Run the client-side Default.html page on your desktop. You will notice that all tabs work except for Edit. Your mission is to build the UI and jQuery logic to get this functionality to work properly against the WebAPI service at http://flintstones.zift.ca/api/flintstones/. 

Follow these steps:

Allow the user to enter the ID of the record that they wish to edit.
Pull data from the server for the ID that the user has chosen and neatly display data on an HTML form.
Allow user to edit all data except the ID.
When user clicks on the "Save" button, update data on the server with the changes.
