This lab involves the Northwind Product, Category and Supplier tables.
Using the Html.EditorForModel helper method, enable the creation, edit, 
and display of only the following columns of the Product entity. 

Product Name	
Supplier	Drop-down-list
Category	Drop-down-list
Unit Price	Two decimal places

Since you are not using code-first development, you must create a partial class for validation of the Product entity.

Change the CSS so that the input fields are placed beside labels. All your error messages must be displayed in red text.
